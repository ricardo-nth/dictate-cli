# Sample Sounds

This repository includes a tiny generated sound pack at `assets/sounds/dictate/`:

- `start.wav`
- `stop.wav`
- `process.wav`
- `error.wav`
- `cancel.wav`

They are intentionally short and can be installed with:

```bash
./install.sh --with-sounds
```

Installed location by default:

```bash
~/.local/share/sounds/dictate
```

To skip sound installation:

```bash
./install.sh --no-sounds
```
